# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
# Problem Statement : 
Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset
‘SampleSuperstore’. You are the business owner of the retail firm and want to see
how your company is performing. You are interested in finding
out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
What all business problems you can derive by looking into the
data? 
# Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis :
# First dashboard (Exploration):
1) California and New York are the states that made huge sales as well as huge profits. 
2) On the other hand, Texas made good sales but experienced loss.
3) Most of the states made profits excepts the 10 red ones.
# Second dashboard (Exploration):
1) Technology products (copiers, phones, accessories) made huge sales and profits.
2) Furniture products made good sales but generated the worst loss (tables, bookcases) compared to other categories.
3) Consumer products made good sales, whereas Home office products didn't.
# Third dashboard (Exploitation):
I focused on the states that generated loss using the following KPIs : Profit, Discount and Sales. The Discount KPI
reveals significant insight. It showed that the states that offered massive discounts experienced heavy losses.
For example,
	a) Top profitable state  : Califoria, profit = 76K euros, average discount offered = 20% or less.          		
	b) Worst profitable state: Texas, profit = -26K euros, average discount offered = 80% or less.
Overall, it is also observed that due to huge discounts offered on individual products, they generated losses.
Being a business owner of the retail firm, I would suggest keeping the discount rates in check (not more than 20%) for the products experiencing loss.
